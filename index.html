                    <p>
                       I am a proud WSU Cougar attending Washington State University in Pullman, Washington.
                       Most of my childhood was spent in-and-around Seattle where I grew up with my family. I began to be passionate
                       about learning how computers work at a very young age. While I was in high school I participated in the Future
                       Business Leaders of America and won several awards at the regional, state, and national level. Those awards highlighted
                       my ability to not only understand computers, but apply that understanding to critical business problems.

                    <p>
                       Coming to college, my dream was to obtain a degree in Computer Science and commision in to the United States Air Force as
                       an officer. However, complications related to childhood asthma disqualified me from serving. Since then, I have dedicated
                       my time to supporting my fellow Computer Science students and I have focused on my career as a programmer and as an advocate for
                       LGBT+ individuals.

                      <p>The bank simulation was a quick project I started working on to better understand databases.</p>
                      <p>My long-term goals with this project are to be able to simulate user authentication and other security practices.</p>
                      <p>Primary Languages/Technologies: Python, SQL, Debian</p>

                      <h3 class="projects">DNA Pattern Matching</h3>
                      <p>Using a matrix identity matching algorithm developed by a graduate student, this software took file inputs from the user and generated a report using the inputs and parameters.</p>
                      <p>The input files are FASTA files and the goal of the program was to detect anti-biotic resistance through pseudo-genes.</p>
                      <p>Primary Languages/Technologies: Python, PyQt GUI</p>

                      <h3 class="projects">CptS Placement Test</h3>
                      <p>A major issue for students in the first two computer science students at WSU (basically introduction to programming with either Python or C) that students find C to be too challenging and other students find the Python course to be too slow.</p>
                      <p>Currently, there is no efficient way for a student who is going to be taking computer science classes to be placed into the Python or the C programming course.</p>
                      <p>I am developing (from the ground up) a test that students will take and a system that will keep track of their success throughout their CS careers and help give us indications of whether or not we should be sending students to the more challening C course</p>

                      <p>As the consumer market introduces more 'Internet of Things' products that provide more in-home network connection, it's helpful to understand what is going on behind the scenes from a high-level perspective.</p>
                      <p>DumbNest is a framework that will be used at Washington State University to demonstrate the aspects of network and application security that are usually abstracted from the user.</p>
                      <p>Currently, we are aqcuiring Zigbee devices that will work within this framework.</p>
                      <p>Primary Languages/Technologies: Python, Zigbee, AES encryption</p>

                      <h3 class="projects">Ceaser Cipher Decryption</h3>
                      <p>One of my first actual out-of-class projects was a python script that broke cesar cipher encryptions.</p>
                      <p>A cesar cipher is simply a rotation of letters given an integer. For example, if I were to encrypt "abcd" with a rotation of 2 it would become "cdef".</p>
                      <p>The program would try one iteration at a time and would test the percentage of English words in the document given a library.</p>
